    <h3><b>Buckingham Palace</b> is a London royal residence and the administrative headquarters of the monarch of the United Kingdom.
         Located in the <b>City of Westminster</b>, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning.</h3>

    <h3>Originally known as <b>Buckingham House</b>, the building at the core of today's palace was a large townhouse built for the <b>Duke of Buckingham</b> in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years.
        It was acquired by <b>King George</b> <i>III</i> in 1761 as a private residence for <b>Queen Charlotte</b> and became known as <i>The Queen's House</i>. During the 19th century it was enlarged by architects <b></b> and <b>Edward Blore</b>, who 
        constructed three wings around a central courtyard. <b>Buckingham Palace</b> became the <i>London</i> residence of the <i>British monarch</i> on the accession of <b> Queen Victoria</b> in <i>1837</i>.</h3>
    <br/>
    <h3>The last major structural additions were made in the late <i>19th</i> and early <i>20th</i>> centuries, including the <b>East Front</b>, which contains the well-known balcony on which the <b>British royal family</b> traditionally congregates 
        to greet crowds. <b>A German bomb</b> destroyed the palace chapel during the Second World War; <b>the Queen's Gallery</b> was built on the site and opened to the public in <i>1962</i> to exhibit works of art from <b>the Royal Collection</b>.</h3>
    <br/>
    <h3>The original <i>early-19th-century</i> interior designs, many of which survive, include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis, on the advice of <b>Sir Charles Long</b>.<b> King Edward VII</b> oversaw a 
        partial redecoration in a <b>Belle Ã‰poque</b> cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the <b>Chinese</b> regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the <b> Royal Pavilion at Brighton</b>
         and from <b>Carlton House</b>. The palace has <i>775</i> rooms, and the garden is the largest private garden in <b>London</b>. The state rooms, used for official and state entertaining, are open to the public each year for most of 
         August and <strong>September</strong> and on some days in winter and spring.</h3>
